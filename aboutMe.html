        <h1>Now to make myself seem interesting</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm James, a trainee full-stack web developer currently pinned down in Somerset by coronavirus but hopefully soon moving to "the big city". When your closest cities are Bath and Wells and you studied in Oxford, London really is massive.</p>
        <p>Unusually for someone who studied engineering and is now going in to software development, my hobbies are outdoor pursuits like climbing, cycling, skiing, windsurfing and hiking. Any chance to do something with speed or heights or danger involved I'll be the first one to sign up (and don't forget what high octane thrills you can get by walking, very underrated). Duke of Edinburgh and Ten Tors were some of my favourite school trips, as well as cycling trips several times a year for every year of my life, I practically grew up in the saddle.</p>
        <p>In school maths and science, especially physics, were my strongest and favourite subjects. I would much rather learn a concept and understand it than just memorise something and parrot it back or make something up (*cough*English*cough*). Those subjects, along with STEM projects and residential weeks meant I really wanted to study engineering at university, I just wasn't sure what branch. Because of this, I applied and was accepted on to the Engineering Science course at the University of Oxford, which had a massive advantage for me of not specialising until I had completed 2 years of study, with the first 2 years being devoted to learning concepts from all branches of engineering, from thermodynamics (boo) to control theory (yay).</p>
        <p>In third and fourth year, I could choose my modules and projects and I was more interested in the control and information engineering side, with some biomedical engineering thrown in to appease my healthcare family (2 vets and a nurse). I took a biomedical project in my third year designing a prosthetic limb and while I enjoyed working in a team for the project, the content of the project didn't grab me and hold my interest. For fourth year, I got to choose another project for my Master's dissertation and I choose to work on a project much more in line with information engineering, testing and then developing multi-agent path finding artificial intelligences with the Oxford Robotics Institute.</p>
        <p>That was it, that project was what sucked my down the rabbit hole of software development as a career. While my coursemates were setting up big experiments using drones or extracting fuel from plants, I was running everything from my laptop (thanks to covid, that was a real advantage). Working with a professor and a PhD student, I was able to take charge of my own learning and set my own targets for my project, breaking it up week by week and steadily improving my knowledge of the subject and my skills at coding in python. Towards christmas, I was able to contribute to a different PhD students research by sending her one of the algorithms that I had implemented to work on the institute's codebase. In the new year, I looked back on code I had written at the start of the project, laughed at my own poor code and re-wrote it all, reducing the time to a solution by an order of magnitude. That rate of improvement kept constant throughout the whole project, and with coronavirus this project became my entire Masters year. I hit all the targets that I had set with my supervisors at the start of the year, with the end product being able to plan paths for multiple robots in the same environment taking in to account inertial constraints, continuous time, edge-convoying and heterogeneous robots, both in terms of size and dynamics. This was a very successful project, we compared it to the nearest available method, continuous conflict based search. It is a massive overstatement to say it blew it out of the water, but it did perform significantly better on a test scenario that was roughly midway between the problems the comparison AI was designed to solve and the type of problem my AI was designed to solve.</p>
        <p>I had a great time on this project, hammering out my ideas on to my laptop. I won't claim to have enjoyed every minute, there were some serious challenges to overcome on the project and some days I though I had bit off more than I could chew. Those challenges had solutions though, and I found them and moved on to the next one. That is the reason I really want to go in to software development. You can hit a challenge in anything you do, but this seems to be the one area that you can just leave, do something else for thirty minutes then get a brainwave and instantly go and see if your idea will work and beat the problem. If it doesn't, in another 30 minutes another idea might.</p>
