            Self-Balancing Footballer
        </h2>
        <p class="FootballerSummary">
            A week-long project to make a controllable football player using lego mindstorms components, as well as MATLAB and Simulink to handle the control elements of the problem. The control system would stabilise the robot allowing it to balance on 2 wheels while being controlled to make it move forward and backwards, turn and kick a football.

            Line Following Robot
        </h2>
        <p class="LineBotSummary">
            Coding a line-following robot from scratch, given the documentation for the microcontroller of the robot and information about the other hardware like the camera, the robot was programmed to follow black lines and make decisions at junctions to navigate a simple environment.

            Multi-Agent Path Finding AI
        </h2>
        <p class="FourYPSummary">
            Developed an algorithm to plan paths for non-holonomic robots with inertial constraints in continuous time, using a discrete representation of an environment that multiple robots are navigating simultaneously. The final algorithm was succesful in testing against competing methods and provably optimal in certain scenarios.

            tldr; robots not crash.
